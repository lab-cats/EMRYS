# Project handoff

This is the canonical current takeover snapshot. The roadmap and acceptance
criteria live in [`../design/PIPELINE_PLAN.md`](../design/PIPELINE_PLAN.md);
commands live in [`RUNBOOK.md`](RUNBOOK.md).

## Checkout

- Branch:
  `post09-runtime-preflight`
- Parent:
  `report-exports-v1`
- Verified parent HEAD:
  `934e471fdfa609ee8bc7c7e44fa38b494e5cf876`
- Parent implementation:
  `d46c2be implement report export bundle`
- Current implementation:
  `0071450 implement runtime preflight`
  plus `2895f33 harden runtime preflight paths`
  and `fd76bfd validate prior preflight rows`
- Package type: implementation plus required documentation patch
- Remote and cluster work: paused

The runtime-preflight branch was created only after fetching remote refs and
verifying a clean, upstream-equal parent and an absent target branch.

## Completed boundary

The local descendant sequence has implemented:

- Steps `00a` through `09`;
- Step `09c` scientific-evidence validation;
- versioned artifact/scientific-review/run-summary/report-receipt schemas;
- explicit read-only artifact indexing;
- canonical run-summary assembly and report-table approvals;
- atomic, receipt-last HTML/PDF/summary-TSV reporting;
- explicit-profile, read-only runtime availability preflight.

## Evidence boundary

| Step/package | Verified state |
| --- | --- |
| `00a` STAR index | cluster-proven |
| `00b` GTF to BED12 | cluster-proven |
| `00c` reference sidecars | cluster-proven |
| `01` STAR alignment | cluster-proven across all six samples |
| `02` canonical BAM | cluster-proven across all six samples |
| `02b` BAM QC | refreshed across all six final Step `02` BAMs |
| `03` RSeQC orientation inference | cluster-proven across all six samples |
| `04` MarkDuplicates | cluster-proven across all six samples |
| `05` SplitNCigarReads | cluster-proven across all six samples |
| `06` mechanical orientation split | cluster-proven across all six samples |
| `07` cohort mpileup | implemented and mocked-bcftools tested locally; no real-runtime or cluster proof |
| `08` VCF preprocessing | implemented; shell/fake-R and guarded real-R tested locally; no cluster proof |
| `09` paired CMH ranking | implemented; shell/fake-R and guarded real-R tested locally; no cluster proof |
| `09c` scientific-evidence tooling | implemented and synthetic-fixture tested; no production review |
| Artifact schemas/adapters/run summary | implemented and synthetic-fixture tested; no production transaction |
| Static report bundle | HTML/PDF/summary TSV/report receipt implemented and tested with the pinned local Quarto/Typst renderer and PDF reader; no production report |
| Runtime preflight | explicit tool, R-namespace, SHA-256, and path-visibility probes implemented and locally fixture-tested; no CSU batch report |

Transaction completion means only that the declared transaction reconciled. It
does not establish that every source exists or passed, nor does it promote
runtime, cluster, scientific, or biological state.

No production artifact index, run summary, report-table approval manifest,
Step `09c` evidence package, or report bundle is recorded in this checkout.
The export evidence is local synthetic-fixture and real-renderer evidence
only.

No CSU runtime profile has been populated or executed in a batch allocation.
The tracked runtime profile is an example contract. Local tests and a
successfully published preflight report would establish only the checks
recorded in their declared context, not workflow runtime validation or
cluster proof.

## Cohort and preserved scientific evidence

The paired-end cohort is:

```text
EV:   ABE_EV_2, ABE_EV_3, ABE_EV4
PUM1: ABE_PUM1_2, ABE_PUM1_3, ABE_PUM1_4
```

Explicit paired strata:

```text
replicate 2: ABE_EV_2 / ABE_PUM1_2
replicate 3: ABE_EV_3 / ABE_PUM1_3
replicate 4: ABE_EV4  / ABE_PUM1_4
```

`ABE_EV4` intentionally lacks an underscore. Pairing comes from explicit
manifest metadata, never from sample names.

Step `03` found all libraries reverse-stranded / first-strand-style:

| Sample | Failed to determine | `1++,1--,2+-,2-+` | `1+-,1-+,2++,2--` |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `ABE_EV_2` | 0.0828 | 0.0432 | 0.8740 |
| `ABE_EV_3` | 0.0964 | 0.0420 | 0.8617 |
| `ABE_EV4` | 0.0908 | 0.0433 | 0.8658 |
| `ABE_PUM1_2` | 0.1063 | 0.0374 | 0.8562 |
| `ABE_PUM1_3` | 0.0955 | 0.0407 | 0.8639 |
| `ABE_PUM1_4` | 0.0926 | 0.0402 | 0.8672 |

The post-hardening `ABE_EV_2` Step `03` rerun matched its earlier report.
`ABE_EV_2` remains a mapping outlier, not an established pipeline failure.

The `FWD_like` and `REV_like` groups are mechanical flag groupings.
`legacy_provisional_v1` is a compatibility policy, not a validated biological
strand model.

Step `09` outputs are CMH-ranked candidates. No validated editing-site or
causal biological conclusion exists.

`science_review_complete_exploratory` remains explicitly provisional.
`biological_interpretation_ready` is reserved and rejected until a separately
approved policy defines and unlocks stricter exit criteria.

## Current blockers

- The full production `samples.tsv` is not in this checkout. Its immutable
  cluster copy, explicit replicate values, persistence, and hash require
  inspection.
- Step `07` lacks real-bcftools and cluster evidence.
- CSU batch-visible R and package availability remain unresolved.
- Storage quota, scratch capacity, and retention policy remain unresolved.
- The exact Novogene annotation release remains partially unresolved.
- No production scientific-evidence review has been completed.

## Immediate resume point

The `post09-runtime-preflight` implementation and documentation gates are
complete. Stop for review before creating `post09-reference-provenance`. When
that package is explicitly approved, begin from this clean, pushed descendant
and follow the package acceptance criteria and lineage in the pipeline plan.

The authoritative continuation sequence is in
[`../design/PIPELINE_PLAN.md`](../design/PIPELINE_PLAN.md).
